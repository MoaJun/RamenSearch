		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct Bundle Size Analysis and Identify Unused Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify specific unused dependencies in core components, analyze dependency tree depth and import patterns, and create a mitigation plan for redundant packages.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep technical analysis of the application's dependency graph, involves tool-specific configuration (Vite build), and necessitates judgment on what constitutes 'unused' code. It has intermediate to high complexity due to potential false positives and need for manual validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Imports for Non-Critical Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify non-critical components to lazy-load, implement dynamic imports with React.lazy and Suspense, and test rendering behavior during transitions.",
			"reasoning": "Involves refactoring existing component structure and managing loading states. Requires understanding of React's lazy loading mechanics and performance trade-offs, but is more straightforward than bundle analysis."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Google Maps API Loading with Lazy Initialization",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement conditional loading using useEffect, add error handling for failed map loads, create a loading spinner UI, and test performance across devices and network conditions.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to external API integration (Google Maps), state management during initialization, error scenarios, and cross-environment testing. Requires robust fallbacks and user experience considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Inline Critical CSS for Core UI Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Extract critical styles from layout components, determine minimal required styles for initial render, and inject them via HTML style tag or pre-rendered block.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward with clear technical boundaries. Requires CSS analysis but less complex than dynamic loading or bundle optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Images to WebP with Lazy Loading",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Convert all static images to WebP format, implement lazy loading for off-screen elements using appropriate attributes and image components.",
			"reasoning": "Well-defined technical task with clear implementation path. Minimal complexity due to standard image optimization practices and browser compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Apply React.memo to Prevent Unnecessary Re-renders",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify components with frequent re-renders, implement React.memo with proper comparison functions, and validate render count reduction in DevTools.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to need for component-level analysis, but execution is predictable and follows standard React patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design Breakpoints for Mobile Devices",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Refactor layout breakpoints using responsive units (rem, vw), ensure touch-friendly spacing and font sizing on mobile devices.",
			"reasoning": "Requires design and development coordination but is primarily a UI/UX task with clear implementation steps. Moderate complexity due to device variability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Search Form Usability with Real-Time Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement autocomplete suggestions using Supabase API, add real-time input validation, and ensure keyboard navigation support for accessibility.",
			"reasoning": "Involves external service integration (Supabase), dynamic UI updates, and accessibility requirements. Requires coordination between frontend logic and user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Keyboard Navigation for All Interactive Elements",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add tabindex, focus management, and accessible labels to all interactive elements; test with screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver) and keyboard navigation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive accessibility requirements across multiple components. Requires thorough testing and attention to edge cases in user interaction."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Boundary for Component-Level Failures",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a global error boundary component, implement fallback UI and error reporting mechanism, and test with known failure scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Standard React pattern with clear implementation. Complexity is low due to well-documented best practices and predictable outcomes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct Cross-Browser and Device Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Test application functionality across Chrome, Safari, Firefox on iOS and Android devices; document visual and functional regressions.",
			"reasoning": "Requires testing across multiple platforms with varying rendering behaviors. Complexity increases due to environmental variability and potential regression risks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Perform Accessibility and Performance Audits with Lighthouse",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Run Lighthouse audits on desktop and mobile views, address critical issues in accessibility (WCAG) and performance metrics, generate a compliance report.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive standards (WCAG), multiple audit categories, and requirement for actionable remediation. Needs deep technical understanding of both accessibility and performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Add Location-Based Restaurant Suggestions (Mobile-Only)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task with a focus on add location-based restaurant suggestions (mobile-only).",
